# HashMorphPro
"Hash Morph Pro" is an enhanced version of the original Hash Morpher code. It includes additional features and improvements that make it more versatile and effective in a wider range of scenarios.

Here's a detailed description of what this code does differently compared to the original one:

File Morphing: The original code only appended two random bytes at the end of the file. The new code, however, inserts a random number of bytes at a random position within the file. This results in a wider range of hash values for the same file, making it harder to detect the morphed files.

Automation: The original code required manual selection of a file to morph. The new code, on the other hand, can automatically target specific types of files or directories. For example, it could target executables or scripts commonly used by antivirus or intrusion detection systems. This feature enhances the code's usability and efficiency.

Enhanced Randomization: The new code introduces enhanced randomization by varying the number of bytes appended and the location where they're inserted. This increases the unpredictability of the hash values, making it more challenging for detection systems to identify the morphed files.

Directory Targeting: The new code can target all files in a directory that have a specific file extension (e.g., .exe, .dll, .ps1). This feature allows for bulk file morphing, which can be particularly useful in scenarios where multiple files need to be morphed at once.

In summary, "Hash Morph Pro" provides a more sophisticated and versatile approach to file morphing, making it a valuable tool for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity operations.
